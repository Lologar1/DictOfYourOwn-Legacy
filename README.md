# DictOfYourOwn
Legacy version. A new, improved version written in C is available in the repository DictOfYourOwn.

Small organizational program for managing conlang vocabulary.

You can import .txt files, each representing one word and its definition (along with tags) into a dictionary. The dictionary can be exported as a .txt file (if you wanted to extract its contents), or browsed through the program. You can search for words by tag, or by regex.
